A good way to practice string concatenation (aka how to put strings together)

- Suppose we want to create a string that says "subscribe to \_\_\_\_"
  Example: youtuber = "Your name"

- A few ways to do this:
  - print("subscribe to " + youtuber)
  - print("subscribe to {}".format(youtuber))
  - print(f"subscribe to {youtuber}") <I will use this because it is the cleanest way to do it>
