# Madlibs

A good way to practice string concatenation (aka how to put strings together)

- Suppose we want to create a string that says "subscribe to \_\_\_\_"
  Example: youtuber = "Your name"

- A few ways to do this:
  - print("subscribe to " + youtuber)
  - print("subscribe to {}".format(youtuber))
  - print(f"subscribe to {youtuber}") <I will use this because it is the cleanest way to do it>

# Guess the Number (CPU)

A good way to pratice loops and the if-else statement

- Computer comes up with a random number and the user guesses the number
- The game stops when the user guesses the correct number

# Guess the Number (User)

Similar to guess the number (CPU).

- Difference is that the user comes up with a random number and the computer guesses the number

# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This game allows you to practice how to use a library and write functions.
You know the game already, right :eyes:

But in case you don't know the rules, the rules are:

- Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock

# Hangman

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

- In our case, the two players are CPU and you (user)
- CPU will guess a random word from the words list in the words.py file
- This program allows you to practice importing from another file/library and using it in your program

# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

- In this game, the user will play against CPU.
- player.py file is used to create the different players (user and CPU), while game.py is used to create the actual gameplay.
- You will learn how to use static methods. [Click link to learn more about it](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-method-vs-static-method-python/)
